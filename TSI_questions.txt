Q1 Why are there no 'string' variables by default in a Type? I understand strings are hard to show in a chart but now the string values in an incomming message are all lost? Or are these just hidden added by default?

Q2 What is the maximum number of instances in TSI? Is this number on par with the number of devices an IoT Hub supports?

Q3 Are calculated fields (like Numeric custom value) also saved in the datalake? So the calculated fields are available for 3rd tooling connecting to the datalake?
